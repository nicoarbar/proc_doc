Hi, 

INTRODUCTION:
  - I´m a Data Engineer that has been working for over 6 years in consulting companies implementing analytical applications, working with Business Intelligence projects for big clients. 

TECH STACK:
  - I´ve worked with traditional BI tools, relational databases, but much more with Cloud environments such as AWS and Azure. 

TASKS:
- I started as an analyst doing data processing scripts/jobs, and also working on the front end part using visualization tools. 
- I moved on to be a cloud engineer doing some architecting on analytical applications and that is where I really learned about the whole AWS ecosystem. 
- Now i´m more involved in the project management as a technical manager:
  - Leading the architectural decisions
  - Managing the dev backend team
  - Developing the vision for our backend:
    - Code review, best practices, coding standards
    - Thinking about how to optimize the code and make it more scalable since the increasin data volume is always a challenge for a data engineer

HOBBIES:
  - I always like learning and get better at what I do, and that is why I´m constantly taking courses and gettin tech certifications. I´m tryin to get some certs on AI engineering, security and architecting. 

YCOMBINATOR:
  - I don´t have any expectations about being here. I do not have any specific idea or a business plan. 
  - I wanted to see which projects are being cooked. If I can fit as a cofounder providing my technical skills as a data engineer and a data architecht that would be great. 
  - Or just meet people that have my similar interests in tech and entrepreneurship. 


CO-FOUNDER:
Hi Raffaela, 

I saw your profile and was caught up by it and I´m curious to know what ideas you have in mind if you´re up to discuss them. 
It seems you have a clear idea of what you want to do in the fintech space, and since you are looking for someone with +5 years of experience in Data Science, I think I might be a good fit for what you´re looking for in a technical co-founder depending on what you have in mind.  

I´ve been a Data Engineer and Data Architecht for 6 years working in consulting companies, holding many cloud certifications and having experience with Data applications, Business Intelligence and Machine Learning projects. 
Since all the AI/Machine Learning projects or ventures require developing an MVP asap, you´re going to want to develop it in a cloud environment. This will allow fast development, avoid a large cost comittment and the possibility of quickly scaling your MVP into a scaled product at a later stage (currently AWS, Azure, and GCP have programs for startups giving free credits for compute and services to ideate, test and develop an MVP). 
So the venture will need a Cloud Architecht with knowledge of the Machine Learning algorithms and services, and that is where I might fit in. 

By the way, I´m currently employed at a consulting company working with international projects but located in Madrid, Spain with the possibility of flexible remote working. But I´m interested in the possibility of entrepreneurship with the right people. 
I´m open to any suggestions, ideas, networking, or if you want to consult me anything regarding cloud architecting, data/ml engineering, or the proper AWS services for your venture I´m here. 

Best regards, 
Nicolas
